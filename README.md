# Jupyter Notebooks and Data Analysis for incident respondes

This is a gentle introduction to the use of Jupyter Notebooks in Incident Reponse and Digital Forensics. It's part of the [FIRST.org](https://www.first.org) training curiculum.

Author: Serge Droz

There are currently four modules available:

 1. Tutorial: A simple notebook demonstrating how data can be analized
 2. Cowrie: A somewhat more involved notebook to analyze honeypot logs
 3. Lesson_01: A more systematic introduction, suitable for self study
 4. Lesson_02: Builds on the previous notebook and looks at the use of APIs to enriche an analysis. This will not run in Jupyterlite.
